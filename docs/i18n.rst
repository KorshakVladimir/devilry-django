Devilry localization
===================================

Devilry uses the Django localization platform/system. This means that:

- Our translations are in the gettext ``.po`` format.
- We mark translation strings in Python code, templates and in JavaScript.


How we organize the translations
================================
Each app translate their own sources. For JavaScript sources, that means that each app hosts their own JavaScript
translation catalog.
