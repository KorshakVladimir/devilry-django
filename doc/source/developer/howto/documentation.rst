How to document Devilry
=======================

Devilry is documented the Sphinx_ documentation generator. You need to learn
how to write *restructured text* and how to use the Sphinx-specific
*restructured text*-directives. All of this is documented on the Sphinx_ website.


Documentation lives ``doc/``. The sources are in ``doc/source``, and the
sources are organized like this:

* ``source/developer`` --- Developer documentation.
    * ``ref/`` --- Module API reference.
    * ``howto/`` --- How-to's. 
* ``source/user`` --- User documentation.
* ``source/admin`` --- Administrator documentation.
