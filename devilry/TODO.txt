- Selenium tests
- Tests for grade_rstschema
    - Including implemenation and testing of deleting SchemaDefinition
      pre_delete Assignment.
- Error when entering invalid usernames
    - MultiSelectCharField should be renamed to something with User in the
      name, and should probably use:
        http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-model-fields/#the-subfieldbase-metaclass
- Published feedback integration with student and grade-display.
    - Show the grade of the latest published feedback, not the latest feedback.

-XMLRPC-client:
	-The grade plug-in used for the current assignment should be listed when running 
	devilry-examiner.py info in the assignment-folder or one of its subfolders
	-An "Initialization successfull" message should show when devilry-examiner.py init is 
	run with succeess
	-The error handling has room for improvement in many places. The following erroneous usages gives
	nasty tracebacks instead of nice messages:
		-devilry-examiner.py -u donald (forgot the login command)
		-devilry-examiner.py feedback -t Good work (forgot the " " around feedback message)
	-The system does not handle norwegian characters in feedback messages.
	-devilry-examiner help sync does not show nicely. Needs a lot of \n
	-If you want to abort login, i.e. because you typed the wrong username, you should be able to press
	ctrl+c to quit the password prompt. ctrl+d works, but produces a nasty traceback


-Regarding registration of examiners to assignment groups:
	-In INF1100, one should be able to register examiners after the deadline, so that all examiners
	get the same amount of assignment groups. The groups that haven't delivered anything doesn't need an
	examiner, and should be removed from the set of groups that gets examiners. 
	Preferably, this distribution of examiners should be done automatically and should rotate each week, so that
	each student gets his deliveries corrected by different examiners throughout the period.

- Filename validation on delivery.
- Should not be possible to change rstschemadef if any schemas has been created.
- Email on delivery and feedback.
- Examiner create new deadline when giving feedback.
- Check permissions on all views.
- Status must not be shown as corrected when there are no deliveries!
- Logging of important actions, like
    - delete
    - deliver
    - change feedback
- Make examiner interface work when no deadline is set.


clean method in BaseNode is not called when e.g. creating new subject

If a user is admin and examiner, the views on the dashboard should indicate.

Student should get a message when the group is closed for deliveries.

Add button 'create and add new' for period/subject/assignments

Improve setting (publishing) time when e.g. creating new assignment.

Users who are not admins on any nodes, should not be able to view the create-pages.


One user can now be added to the same group twice. Should not be possible.
