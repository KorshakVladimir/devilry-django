- Selenium tests
- Tests for grade_rstschema
    - Including implemenation and testing of deleting SchemaDefinition
      pre_delete Assignment.
- Error when entering invalid usernames
    - MultiSelectCharField should be renamed to something with User in the
      name, and should probably use:
        http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/custom-model-fields/#the-subfieldbase-metaclass

-XMLRPC-client:
	-The grade plug-in used for the current assignment should be listed when running 
	devilry-examiner.py info in the assignment-folder or one of its subfolders
	-An "Initialization successfull" message should show when devilry-examiner.py init is 
	run with succeess
	-The error handling has room for improvement in many places. The following erroneous usages gives
	nasty tracebacks instead of nice messages:
		-devilry-examiner.py -u donald (forgot the login command)
		-devilry-examiner.py feedback -t Good work (forgot the " " around feedback message)
	-The system does not handle norwegian characters in feedback messages.
	-devilry-examiner help sync does not show nicely. Needs a lot of \n
	-If you want to abort login, i.e. because you typed the wrong username, you should be able to press
	ctrl+c to quit the password prompt. ctrl+d works, but produces a nasty traceback


-Regarding registration of examiners to assignment groups:
  - In INF1100, one should be able to register examiners after the deadline, so that all examiners
	get the same amount of assignment groups. The groups that haven't delivered anything doesn't need an
	examiner, and should be removed from the set of groups that gets examiners. 
	Preferably, this distribution of examiners should be done automatically and should rotate each week, so that
	each student gets his deliveries corrected by different examiners throughout the period.

- Filename validation on delivery.
- Should not be possible to change rstschemadef if any schemas has been created.
- Check permissions on all views.
- Logging of important actions, like
    - delete
    - deliver
    - change feedback
- Deadlines in cli
- Publish feedback with cli
- Login to UiO from cli
- RstSchemaDefinition matching query does not exist
- Let student see the schema
- Deadline text visible to student


If a user is admin and examiner, the views on the dashboard should indicate.

Add button 'create and add new' for period/subject/assignments

Improve setting (publishing) time when e.g. creating new assignment.

Users who are not admins on any nodes, should not be able to view the create-pages.

One user can now be added to the same group twice. Should not be possible. 

Inteligent file size. (eg. 'ls -h')

Fix sort order on assignments. (Now it shows "Oblig 2" above "Oblig 1")
