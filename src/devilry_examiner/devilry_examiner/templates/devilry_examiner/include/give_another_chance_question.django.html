Include template to "give another chance" to a group when they have been given
a failing grade. We show this on the delivery where the feedback was given,
and on the singlegroupoverview for any corrected group with failing grade.

Required template context variables:

    group
        The AssignmentGroup.
    request
        Will be available as long as you do not supply the ``only`` parameter to the include tag.
