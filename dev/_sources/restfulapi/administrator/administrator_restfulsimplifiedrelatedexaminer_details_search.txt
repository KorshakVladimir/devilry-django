Request example
###############

.. code-block:: javascript

    GET /administrator/restfulsimplifiedrelatedexaminer/

    {
        query: 'a query string',
        filters: [{field:"period", comp:"contains", value:15},
                      {field:"username", comp:"<", value:"My example value"}],
        orderby: ["id", "-username", "period"],
        start: 10,
        limit: 100
    }



Optional request parameters
###########################

Optional request parameters are encoded as a JSON object and sent as the
request body as shown in the example above.

query
-----
A string to search for. If this is empty or not given, all
related examiners that the authenticated user has access to is
returned.

If the string is not empty, the ``query``-string is split on whitespace,
resulting in a list of words. Every *word* in the list is searched for
*case-insensitive* matches within the following fields:

    
        username
            Actual location of the field:
                :class:`devilry.apps.core.models.relateduser.RelatedExaminer`
            About the field:
                A username. Max 30 characters, a-z, A-Z, and _
            Type
                String
    





filters
-------

Filters can be used to perform complex queries. The ``filters`` parameter is a
list of filters, where each filter is a map with the following entries:

    field
        A field name.
    comp
        A comparison operator.
    value
        The value to filter on.

Example:

    .. code-block:: javascript

        [{field:"period", comp:"contains", value:15},
         {field:"username", comp:"<", value:"My example value"}]

related examiners can be filtered on the following *fields*:


    period
        Actual location of the field:
            :class:`devilry.apps.core.models.Period`
        About the field:
            Autogenerated identifier.
        Type
            Integer
        Supported comparison operators:
            ``startswith``, ``contains``, ``>=``, ``<=``, ``icontains``, ``iexact``, ``endswith``, ``exact``, ``<``, ``>``.

    username
        Actual location of the field:
            :class:`devilry.apps.core.models.relateduser.RelatedExaminer`
        About the field:
            A username. Max 30 characters, a-z, A-Z, and _
        Type
            String
        Supported comparison operators:
            ``startswith``, ``contains``, ``>=``, ``<=``, ``icontains``, ``iexact``, ``endswith``, ``exact``, ``<``, ``>``.







exact_number_of_results
-----------------------
If given, this must be a positive integer (including 0), which specifies the exact number of
expected results. This enables searches that you know should fail if they do not get this
exact number of results, such as filtering for a User by unique username
instead of its numeric ID (where you should expect exactly one result).


orderby
-------
List of fieldnames. Order the result by these fields.
Fieldnames can be prefixed by ``'-'`` for descending ordering.

start
-----
After query, filters and orderby have been executed, the result is limited to
the values from *start* to *start+limit*. Start defalts to ``0``.

limit
-----
Limit results to this number of items. Defaults to ``50``.

Example
------------------------

*note that the is wrong in the example. The id is always unique. However, the
example is generated from a non-varying dataset.*

.. code-block:: javascript

    200 OK

    {
        total: 20,
        items: [
            { id: 15,
              username: "My example value",
              period: 15 },
            { id: 15,
              username: "My example value",
              period: 15 },

        ]
    }


Success response details
------------------------

Responds with HTTP code *200* and a *JSON encoded* dict containing the list of
results and the *total* number of items found before applying ``limit`` and
``start``. Each result in the
list is a JSON object where the *key* is a fieldname and the associated value is
the *value* for that field. The result always contains the following fields:

    
        id
            Actual location of the field:
                :class:`devilry.apps.core.models.relateduser.RelatedExaminer`
